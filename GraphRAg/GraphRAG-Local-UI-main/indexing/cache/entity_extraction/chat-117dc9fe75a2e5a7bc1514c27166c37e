Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

This article gives an overview of the situation in thefield of analytical sciences and ends with some recommendations in favour of using the term \u201cselectivity\" only.  \n\nOneof the key roles of the analytical chemist is to develop the measurement tools in order to generate qualitative and quantitative information on the content of samples.  \n\nSince the advent of modern in st rumental analytical methods,the field of an aly ti cal chemistry has improved enormously The quality of data has often been expressed in figures of merit such as pre cision,accuracy and detection or quant if ica tion limits.
