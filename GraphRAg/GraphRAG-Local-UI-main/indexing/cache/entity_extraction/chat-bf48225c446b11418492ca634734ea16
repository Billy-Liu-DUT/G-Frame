The signing ceremony for this multi-lateral,mutual recognition arrangement (ILAC Arrangement) was held during the General Assembly meeting OfILAC.  \n\nILACfirst started as a conference in 1978 with the aim of developing internat ional cooperation for facilitating trade by promotion of the acceptance of accredited test and calibration results.In1996,ILAC became a formal cooperation with a charter to establish a network of mutual rec ognition agreements among accreditation bod- ies that would fulfil this aim.TheILAC Arrangement is the culmination of 22years of intensive work.  \n\n# Purpose  \n\nThe aim of theILAC Arrangement is to develop a global network of accredited testing and calibration laboratories that can be relied on to provide accurate results.  \n\nThe ILAC Arrangement, which entered into effect on 31 January 2001,provides technical underpinning to international trade by promoting cross-borders take hold er confidence and acceptance of accredited laboratory data.Untilnow,there has been no international mutual recognition agreement in laboratory accreditation.Thishas been a hindrance for some types of international trade, particularly those products which have had to undergo re-testing or recalibration upon entry to importing coun- tries.The Arrangement should facilitate thistrade.  \n\nEach signatory:  \n\n(i) recognises the operation of othersystems - within the programs defined in the Arrangement- as equivalent to its own;\n\n (ii) recommends and promotes the acceptance of the calibration certificates and test reports from the laboratories accredited by the other signatories as being on an equal basis with those of its own accredited laboratories;\n\n \uff08i11\uff09 investigates all complaints initiated by a signatory resulting from cert if icates or reports issued by the labor atories it has accredited within its accredit ation programs;\n\n (iv) notifies all other signatories as soon as possible of any significant changes that have occurred or will occur in its status,in the operational practices of its system or in its accreditation programs;\n\n (v) contributes as appropriate to the work of the Arrangement Council;\n\n (vi) participates as\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 32678, "n": 1}}
