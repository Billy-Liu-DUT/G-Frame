Unger  \n\n# The ILAC Arrangement -- Part I  \n\nSince its signing at ILAC 2000last year, theILAC Arrangement has attracted conside r able interest.It is crucial that both I LAC members and stakeholders fully under stand the structure and operation of the Arrangement if they are to effectively promote it within their own economy.This article is the first part of a paper prepared by Peter Unger, Chair of the ILAC Arrangement Management Committee,which examines the I LAC Arrangement and how it works in some detail.This first part looks at the purpose of theILAC Arrangement, the obligations ofits signatories,thefoundations of the Arrangement and how it works. Part II will be published in a later issue of this journal.  \n\nAbstract As of August 2001,38laborato- ry accreditation bodies of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) have signed the multi-lateral,mutual recognition arrangement (the \"ILAC Arrangement\")to promote the acceptance of accredited test and calibration data.This Arrangement provides significant technical underpinning to international trade. Until now, there has been no international mutual recognition agreement in laboratory accredit ation,which has been a hindrance for some types of international trade.Thekey to the Arrangement is the developing glob al network of accredited testing andcalib ration laboratories that are assessed and recognised as being competent by I LAC Arrangement signatory accreditation bodies.The signatories have,in turn,been peer-reviewed and shown to meet I LAC's criteria for competence.Nowthatthe ILAC Arrangement is in place, government s can take advantage of it to further develop or enhance trade agreements.The ultimate aim is increased use and accept ance by industry,as well as government, of the results from accredited laboratories, including results from laboratories in other countries.Inthisway,thefree-tradegoal of\"a product tested once and accepted everywhere'can be realised.  \n\n# Introduction  \n\nOn 2 November 2000,36 laboratory accredit ation bodies,full members of the In ter national Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation(ILAC\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 32678, "n": 1}}
