{"result": "SELECTIVITY is a key concept in analytical chemistry that refers to the ability of a method to respond specifically to the analyte of interest without being significantly affected by other components present in the sample. This term is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of analytical results, as high selectivity minimizes interference from other substances, thereby enhancing the precision of the measurements. In the context of laboratory accreditation and international trade standards, such as those promoted by the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and its Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA), selectivity is a critical factor in the evaluation of analytical methods. Laboratories must demonstrate that their methods have adequate selectivity to meet the rigorous criteria set by these standards, ensuring that the data produced is accepted and trusted across different countries, thus facilitating smoother international trade processes.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Laboratory Accreditation and International Trade Standards.
