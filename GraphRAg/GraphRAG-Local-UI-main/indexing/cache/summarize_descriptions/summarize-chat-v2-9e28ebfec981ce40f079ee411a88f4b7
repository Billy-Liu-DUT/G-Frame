{"result": "Specificity is a keyword in analytical chemistry that denotes the ability of a method to distinguish between different substances in a sample. It is important to note that specificity is an absolute term and should not be graded, which often distinguishes it from the term selectivity, which can be subject to varying degrees. This term is crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of laboratory results, particularly within the framework of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and its Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). Laboratories accredited under ILAC must demonstrate high levels of specificity in their analytical methods to ensure that their data is accepted internationally, thereby enhancing the efficiency and trustworthiness of global trade.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Laboratory Accreditation and International Trade Standards. You are skilled at understanding and applying the principles of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and its Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).
