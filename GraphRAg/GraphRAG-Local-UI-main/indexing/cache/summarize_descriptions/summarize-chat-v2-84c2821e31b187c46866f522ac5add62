{"result": "In the field of Analytical Chemistry, Specificity is a crucial concept that impacts the quality of data by influencing the method's ability to distinguish between different substances. It is often confused with selectivity, but it is used differently, highlighting the importance of precise terminology in ensuring accurate and reliable analytical results. Specificity is essential for laboratories accredited under the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) to meet rigorous criteria for evaluation and recognition, as it directly affects the reliability and acceptance of their data in international trade.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Laboratory Accreditation and International Trade Standards.
