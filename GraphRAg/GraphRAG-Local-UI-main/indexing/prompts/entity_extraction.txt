-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is English. The text discusses the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and its mutual recognition arrangements, which are technical subjects typically written about in English within the scientific and accreditation communities. Despite some typographical errors and unusual spacing, the vocabulary, grammar, and context are unmistakably English. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter. If you have to translate, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:

ILAC-recognised regions with acceptable mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs)and evaluation procedures.The Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation (IAAC) and Southern African Development Cooperation for Accreditation (SADCA)arestill developing theirMRA evaluation processes before requesting rec- ognition and approval by ILAC. Other regional arrangements being developed in other parts of the world are in their infancy. Bodies that cannot be affiliated with are co gnis ed region may apply directly to I LAC for evaluation and recognition  

(PartI on the Arrangement will exam in e the peer review process in detail,the maintenance of the Arrangement and its future).
