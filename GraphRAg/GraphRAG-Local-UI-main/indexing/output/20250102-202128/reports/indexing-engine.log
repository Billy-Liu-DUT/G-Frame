Board, it was decided to make some minor changes of convention and policy in the Journal, as described below.  \n\n(1) In future, short announcements of important advances for which urgent publication is appropriate, and which are to be followed in due course by full papers, will be called \"Preliminary Communications\". Such Preliminary Communications (previously known as \"Preliminary Notes\") will be given priority, and published as rapidly as possible.  \n\nAlong with this change, short definitive papers not exceeding four printed pages (previously known as \"Short Communications\") will be called \"Notes'. The same criteria of quality apply to Notes as to ordinary papers, and the only essential difference lies in the length, but an ordinary paper will include a summary whereas a Note will not. Papers of less than four printed pages in length will be treated as Notes.  \n\n(2) Because of increasing pressure in the space in the Journal, the following additional restrictions on subject content will be introduced:  \n\nWJ rapcs ou oigauupuus (ii) Papers on the chemistry of organometallic compounds in which the metal. has no significant role will not be accepted. The intention is mainly to exclude those. papers dealing with reactions at functional organic centres in compounds in which. a metal atom is relatively remotely and almost incidentally attached, and is without any apparent influence on the reactions described..  \n\n(iii) Papers consisting wholly or mainly of reports of spectroscopic data. (including fragmentation patterns from mass spectral studies) will be accepted only if the interpretations of such data have clear general implications..  \n\nJ. Organometal.

Board, it was decided to make some minor changes of convention and policy in the Journal, as described below.  \n\n(1) In future, short announcements of important advances for which urgent publication is appropriate, and which are to be followed in due course by full papers, will be called "Preliminary Communications". Such Preliminary Communications (previously known as "Preliminary Notes") will be given priority, and published as rapidly as possible.  \n\nAlong with this change, short definitive papers not exceeding four printed pages (previously known as "Short Communications") will be called "Notes\'. The same criteria of quality apply to Notes as to ordinary papers, and the only essential difference lies in the length, but an ordinary paper will include a summary whereas a Note will not. Papers of less than four printed pages in length will be treated as Notes.  \n\n(2) Because of increasing pressure in the space in the Journal, the following additional restrictions on subject content will be introduced:  \n\nWJ rapcs ou oigauupuus (ii) Papers on the chemistry of organometallic compounds in which the metal. has no significant role will not be accepted. The intention is mainly to exclude those. papers dealing with reactions at functional organic centres in compounds in which. a metal atom is relatively remotely and almost incidentally attached, and is without any apparent influence on the reactions described..  \n\n(iii) Papers consisting wholly or mainly of reports of spectroscopic data. (including fragmentation patterns from mass spectral studies) will be accepted only if the interpretations of such data have clear general implications..  \n\nJ. Organometal.
